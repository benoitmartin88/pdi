\mainpage About

%PDI supports [loose coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) of
simulation codes with libraries:
* the simulation code is annotated in a library-agnostic way,
* libraries are used from the \ref Specification_tree "specification tree".

This approach works well for a number of concerns including: parameters reading, data
initialization, post-processing, result storage to disk, visualization, fault
tolerance, logging,  inclusion as part of code-coupling, inclusion as part of an
ensemble run, etc.
