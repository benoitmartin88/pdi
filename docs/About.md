\mainpage About

%PDI supports [loose coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) of
simulation codes with libraries:
* the simulation code is annotated in a library-agnostic way,
* libraries are used from the \ref Specification_tree "specification tree".

This approach works well for a number of concerns including:
* parameters reading,
* data initialization,
* post-processing,
* result storage to disk,
* visualization,
* fault tolerance,
* logging, 
* inclusion as part of code-coupling,
* inclusion as part of an ensemble run,
* etc.
