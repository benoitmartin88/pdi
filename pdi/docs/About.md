\mainpage About

%PDI supports [loose coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) of
simulation codes with libraries:
* the simulation code is annotated in a library-agnostic way,
* libraries are used from the \ref Specification_tree "specification tree".

This approach works well for a number of concerns including: parameters reading, data
initialization, post-processing, result storage to disk, visualization, fault
tolerance, logging,  inclusion as part of code-coupling, inclusion as part of an
ensemble run, etc.

# Join the team

You can work with us to make a better %PDI:
* a 3-years engineer position: ["Improvement and integration of the PDI library for High-performance code coupling"](http://www.maisondelasimulation.fr/en/emploi/3-years-engineer-position-improvement-and-integration-of-the-pdi-library-for-high-performance-code-coupling-2/),
* a 2-years post-doc position: ["Data-driven code-coupling at Exascale"](http://www.maisondelasimulation.fr/en/emploi/2-years-post-doc-position-data-driven-code-coupling-at-exascale-2/),
* and we are always looking for people interested in an internship, [drop an email if you are insterested](mailto:julien.bigot@cea.fr).
