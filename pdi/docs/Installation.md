\page Installation Installation of %PDI

There are three ways to install %PDI:
1. the [pre-compiled binary packages](https://github.com/pdidev/repo) for
   Debian, Fedora and Ubuntu,
2. [Spack recipes](https://github.com/pdidev/spack),
3. the source distribution.


\section installation_using_binary_packages Installation using binary packages

The [pre-compiled binary packages](https://github.com/pdidev/repo) are
recommended on distributions where they are available: Debian, Fedora, and
Ubuntu.
They do however require root access and do not offer full control over the
compilation options used.

\section installation_using_spack_recipes Installation using Spack recipes

[PDI recipes](https://github.com/pdidev/spack) for [Spack](https://spack.io) are
recommended when root access is not available, on other distributions, or when
requiring fine control over the compilation options used; for example on a
supercomputer.
