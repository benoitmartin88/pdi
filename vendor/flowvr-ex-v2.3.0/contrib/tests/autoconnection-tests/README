Test:
        - the resolution of AUTO/SAMEAS ports (resolveMsgTypes controller)
        - the automatic insertion of connections (setConnections controller)

- This is based on the Pirmes exmaple with addition tests.
- Tests triggered when running cmake using CTEST
-  Many of these tests are not supposed to lead to application than can actually run correclty, but they should produce correct .net.xml networks
