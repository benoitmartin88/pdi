FlowVR
======

Overview
--------

FlowVR is a middleware library that eases development and execution of
high performance interactive applications requiring to harness the power of computing nodes distributed in a cluster or grid. 
FlowVR has been used for virtual reality application, telepresence, multi-camera  real-time 3D modeling, in-situ visualization, 
steering of parallel molecular dynamics applications, etc.     FlowVR  reuses  and  extends the  data  flow  paradigm
commonly   used  for   scientific   visualization  environments.    An application  is  seen  as   a  set  of  possibly  distributed  modules
exchanging  data. Different  module assemblies can be  specified  without modification or recompilation of the modules. The application developper does not have to 
bother about networking issues. That's the job of FlowVR to manage and optimize data exchanges between modules.  FlowVR supports parallel modules, enabling to 
harness existing MPI  codes for instance. This  feature is commonly used for in-situ visualization or computational steering. 

FlowVR  is developed at INRIA / LIG   with code contrinbutions 
from the  LIFO, Universite d'Orleans


Installation
------------

FlowVR uses CMake for compilation.
Its basic principle is to parse the CMakeLists.txt file, offer you
compilation options and then generate makefiles accordingly.

Create a BUILD directory, cd to it then call "ccmake ../."

bIf you don't have ccmake or if you haven't installed the dependencies yet,
it is time to do so using the provided script "flowvr-dep-install.sh".

Choose the options you want to activate then press "c" for configure.
A summary appears showing you the activated/disabled components, as well
as any problem encountered. Press "e" to exit the summary. You might have
to cycle through several configure cycles.

When CMake is ready, it will offer you the option of generating makefiles
by pressing "g".

All that's left is to call them using "make" and "make install".
