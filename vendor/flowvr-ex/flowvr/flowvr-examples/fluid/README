	Fluid
===============================
	What does it do?
===============================
    * Example of application coupling different codes
 	* Ssequential fluid simulation
 	* You can:
                - mix the fluid with the mouse 
                - inject blue or green fluid with left/right mouse buttons
                - toggle display fo velocity/density with 'v' key.
===============================



===============================
	How to start it
===============================
	You can start it by executing a single script

flowvr-demo-fluid.sh

	If you do not have it in your $PATH, execute "source bin/flowvr-suite-config.sh"
	at the root of your install directory.


===============================
	How to start it Manually
===============================

In order to start it manually:

	* Execute "flowvrd &" in your terminal or "flowvrd -t" in a separate terminal.
		- Only one daemon may run on a given machine.
		- If you need to bring back a command from the background, run "fg".
		- To close the daemon, use CTRL-C.
		
flowvrd &
		
		
	* Compile the application's modules using the provided makefile.
./make-app.sh

	* Add relevant folder to your PATH environnemnt variable
source ./bin/fluid-config.sh 
		
	* Generate the application's network:
python fluid.py
		
	* Launch the application using the "flowvr" command.
flowvr fluid
                
		
		While the application is running, your terminal will listen
		to commands for controlling the application flow.

		To get a list of available commands, type "pause", press ENTER to confirm,
		then type "help" and confirm.


	* When you are done, type "stop" and confirm.
	
	* If the application has trouble coming to a full halt, run :

flowvr-kill


===============================
	Troubleshooting
===============================

	* The daemon won't start properly
		1) make sure you've executed the "setup-sharedmemory.sh" script
			This script sets the shared memory segment size to a big enough value
			in order to accomodate the daemon.
			
		2) check if there isn't a daemon already running
		3) run "killall flowvrd" if you haven't found any
		
	* The application starts, but it doesn't exchange messages
		- run "flowvr-kill" and try once more
		
	
	If none of these helped, send us an email at "flowvr-devel@lists.sourceforge.net".
