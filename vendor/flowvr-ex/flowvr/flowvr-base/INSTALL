  FLOWVR-BASE Installation Notes


    Dependencies

You need the usual tools for compilation (make,gcc).
To compile some FlowVR based tools you need pkg-config.
For example, on a Mandrake distribution with configured urpmi sources:

  urpmi -a pkgconfig


    Compilation

To compile, simply use 'make' in the root directory.
Executables are generated in bin directory
Libraries are generated in lib directory


    Installation

To execute the programs you must add the lib directory in
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

# change paths and add this in ~/.bashrc
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/flowvr-base/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=~/flowvr-base/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

The PKG_CONFIG_PATH is necessary to compile projects that depends
on FlowVR.
