What is it?
===========

This is a set of alternative visualization tools for flowvr
graphs. They may be useful because flowvr-glgraph's are difficult to
read for complex graphs.

netxml2dot.py is a script that transforms a flowvr .net.xml file into
a dot file that can be rendered by graphviz's dot, similar to flowvr-graph. 

to_filesys.py transforms the component tree into a directory tree,
where links become symlinks. In this way, classical unix utilities
(ls, cd, find) and filename completion can be used to explore the
tree.

browse_graph.py displays nodes of the FlowVR graph as hyperlinked web
pages. A web server is launched to generate the pages dynamically.


How does it work?
=================

All scripts are implemented in Python, they use the .xml files
generated by the flowvr program.

netxml2dot.py builds the tree corresponding to the component tree, and
converts it to the dot language. Similar nodes in the graph can be
merged (-merge option), normally this should be able to
reverse-engineer pattern-parallels.


Examples
========

The scripts does not need to be compiled or installed, they are
independent of flowvr runtime components. Below are a few examples on
the classical primes graph. They were tested also on the grimage graph.

netxml2dot.py example
---------------------

n=primes; python netxml2dot.py -scalef 1.5 -merge $n.net.xml $n.dot && dot -Tpdf -o$n.pdf $n.dot && xpdf $n.pdf

NB that dot (tried with 2.27.20110107.0545) is very unstable, it tends
to crash often on hierarchical graphs. This means that the tool is not
very useful in practice.


to_filesys.py example
---------------------

python to_filesys.py primes.net.xml .

find ./net_xml_to_filesys/    # displays all the components and links of the graph


browse_graph.py example
-----------------------

python browse_graph.py -prefix primes

will use all avalable xml files and launch a http server on port 8080
from which the graph can be explored. Point the browser on 

http://localhost:8080/
