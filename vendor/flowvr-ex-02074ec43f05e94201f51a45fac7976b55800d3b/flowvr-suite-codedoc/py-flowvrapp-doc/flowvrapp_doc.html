<h2>What is FlowvrApp?</h2>

<h3>Vocabulary</h3>

<p>
The FlowVR middleware is based on a graph.  Each node
(<b>Primitive</b>) of the graph is an event-driven computation
loop. Primitives have input and output <b>Ports</b>. Edges of the
graph connect output ports to input ports. Primitives are identified
by a unique name (or id), ports have a name which is unique within the
primitive they belong to. Data blocks, or <b>messages</b> can be sent
through the ports from one primitive to another.

<p>
A <b>Module</b> is a primitive that is run as an independent
program. A <b>Synchronizer</b> or a <b>Filter</b> primitive is running
on the FlowVR daemon (<code>flowvrd</code>).

<h3>FlowVR setup</h3>

<p>
To set up the graph, the <code>flowvr</code> command uses two
configuration files (myapp is the application name):
<ul>

      <li> <code>myapp.run.xml</code> contains the command lines to start
      up the modules.

      <li> <code>myapp.cmd.xml</code> lists the filters and
      synchronizers that have to be start up, and the connections that
      should be established between ports.

</ul>

<h3>FlowvrApp</h3>

FlowvrApp is an API used to describe the FlowVR graph. It can be used
to generate the <code>myapp.run.xml</code> and <code>myapp.cmd.xml</code>
files, which are often too verbose to edit by hand.

<p>
FlowVRApp is written with  Python. Previous versions of FlowVR ( &lt; 1.7. ) relied on deprecated C++ and Perl utilities.</p>



<h3>This document</h3>

This document presents FlowvrApp through a series of examples of
increasing complexity. Examples require a functional FlowVR
installation, but no previous knowledge about FlowVR is assumed. 

<p>
Basic knowledge about the Python language is preferable (you may want
to look at the <a
href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/tutorial/introduction.html">Python
tutorial</a>). Also some familiarity with the shell is useful (setting
paths, essentially), the shell used here is bash.


<hr>


<h2>A simple example: tictac</h2>

Here we present the steps to make a module send text messages to
another one. We assume that the FlowVR commands are in the path. If
this is not the case, source <code>flowvr-config.sh</code>
(found in FlowVR's install dir).

<h3>Two modules</h3>

The <i>put</i> module has a single output port, <i>text</i>. It
sends the text "tic" and "tac" alternatively on this port. The module
<i>get</i> has an input port <i>text</i> and displays all messages
arriving on this port.

<p>
First the modules must be compiled. For this, go to subdirectory
<code>&lt;flowvr source
dir&gt;/flowvr/flowvr-examples/tictac</code>. Then run
<br>
<pre>
bash make_app.sh
</pre>
<br>
the executables <code>get</code> and <code>put</code> are now in the
<code>bin/</code> subdirectory. If you try to run them direclty, they
will complain that they cannot register with FlowVR. 

<h3>Graph description</h3>

The FlowVRApp code that describes the graph is

<pre>
from flowvrapp import *

putmodule = Module("put", cmdline = "bin/put")
outport = putmodule.addPort("text", direction = "out")

getmodule = Module("get", cmdline = "bin/get")
inport = getmodule.addPort("text", direction = "in")

outport.link(inport)

app.generate_xml("tictac")
</pre>
<a href="tictac_0.py" type="text/x-script.phyton">code</a>


<p>
Let's walk through the code: 
<ul>
      <li> The <code>import</code> statement is to make all definitions
      from the flowvrapp library available in subsequent code.

      <li> The <code>Module(...)</code> statement calls a constuctor
      for a module object. It requires at least a name in the graph
      ("put") and a command line that corresponds to the module
      ("bin/put", the path to the executable). It is recommended to
      use the <code>parameter = value</code> notation Python allows, to clarify
      what parameter is passed.

      <li> Ports of primitives are defined with the
      <code>addPort</code> method, that also needs a name. Caution! 
      The name of the port in FlowvrApp must be exactly the same as
      the name that is used in the module's code. However, not all the
      ports that are defined in the module's code need to be declared
      in FlowvrApp. The <code>addPort</code> method retuns the
      created port. It can also be retrieved with
      <code>module.getPort(portname)</code>.

      <li> Ports are linked with
      <code>outport.link(inport)</code>. Order matters: the reverse
      does not work. A single output port can be linked to several input ports, 
      but not the way round.

      <li> <code>app</code> is an object that implicitly records all
      declared primitives. Its <code>generate_xml</code> method
      produces the XML files used by <code>flowvr</code> to start the FlowVR
      application. Its argument is the prefix used for those XML files.

</ul>

<p>
To generate the graph, put the above code in a file file
<code>tictac_0.py</code> in the same directory (<code>&lt;flowvr
source dir&gt;/flowvr/flowvr-examples/tictac/</code>). 
In this example, the <code>cmdline = ... </code> arguments
explicitly indicate the path to the module exectuables.

<a name="configpy">
<p>
You have to tell Python where to find the FlowVR app library, with:
<pre>
  export PYTHONPATH=&lt;flowvr source dir&gt;/flowvr-contrib/utils/py_flowvrapp
</pre>
then run:
<pre>
  python tictac_0.py
</pre>

<p>
This command produces the <code>tictac.run.xml</code> and
<code>tictac.cmd.xml</code> files required to start the FlowVR
application. The graph can be viewed with <code>flowvr-glgraph
tictac.net.xml</code>: 

<p>
<img src="tictac_0.png">

<h3>Run</h3>

In a separate terminal, start the FlowVR daemon <code>flowvrd</code>. It
is required to coordinate the execution of any FlowVR application.

<!--
<p>
To run the application, Flowvr must be able to find the module
executables. Therefore, "get" and "put" should be in the PATH
environment variable:
<pre>
  export PATH=$PATH:&lt;flowvr source dir&gt;/flowvr/flowvr-examples/tictac/
</pre>
(the full path could also be provided in the <code>cmdline =
...</code> option in <code>tictac.py</code>).
--> 

<p>
Run the application with
<pre>
  flowvr tictac
</pre>
This will display the sent and received messages on the console. Stop the application
with ctrl-C or by typing "stop" (FlowVR displays a prompt that is not
always visible due to the the module outputs).


<h3>Run on several machines</h3>

FlowVR is especially powerful to coordinate many machines running even
more modules. Let's run <i>get</i> and <i>put</i> on two machines: mohawk
and opata (adjust to your needs).


<h4>In the code</h4>

The simplest part is to change the <code>tictac.py</code> code. Just
add an argument to the Module constructors:
<br><pre>
...
putmodule = Module("put", cmdline = "bin/put", <b>host = "mohawk"</b>)
...
getmodule = Module("get", cmdline = "bin/get", <b>host = "opata"</b>)
</pre>
<a href="tictac_1.py" type="text/x-script.phyton">code</a>

<p>
Regenerate the XML files with <code>python tictac_1.py</code>.

<p>
When there are many modules to run on a single host, it can become
tedious to specify the host at each time. The default host (that is
set when the <code>host</code> parameter unspecified) is
<code>app.default_host</code>, which can be adjusted to something else
than "localhost".


<h4>Running</h4>

<p>
To run a FlowVR application over several machines: 
<ul>
      <li> FlowVR should be installed on all machines. The simplest
      way to guarantee this is to install it in a shared directory
      that is mounted in the same location on all participating
      machines.

      <li> The machines should be reachable by ssh without password
      from the machine the <code>flowvr</code> client is run on. In
      addition, the FlowVR utilities must be in the path (make sure
      <code>flowvr-config.sh</code> is sourced in the shell's startup
      scripts)

      <li> The FlowVR daemon <code>flowvrd</code> must be running on
      all the machines, so start it up on both hosts.

</ul>

<p>
The application can be run in the same way:
<pre>
  flowvr tictac
</pre>


<h4>Debugging</h4>

To debug FlowvrApp problems, just add <code>print</code>'s or
<code>pdb.set_trace()</code>'s in the Python code. You can also
pinpoint problems by looking at the generated XML files. 

<p>
The <code>flowvr</code> launcher outputs a lot of messages on startup,
and the output from the modules (including "segmentation fault"
messages) appears there. If something does not work as expected look
carefully in this output. The output of individual modules can be
redirected to log files (prefix <code>log-</code>) with
<code>flowvr</code>'s <code>-l</code> option.

<p>
When an application is not closed properly (eg. if it crashed or is
stopped with Ctrl-C), the modules must often be killed manually, and
flowvrd restarted. The command <code>flowvr-kill</code> kills "zombie"
modules running on the current host.

<p>
To debug synchronization problems (deadlocks, flooded message
queues,...), <code>flowvrd</code> can be run with the
<code>--top</code> option, that displays the number of messages on
each queue.


<h3>Module objects</h3>

When modules get more complicated, and if they are used several times,
it is convenient to define a specific class for them.

<p>
The class must inherit the <code>Module</code> class. Most often, it
contains only code in the constructor. For example:
<pre>

class PutModule(Module): 
  " a module that puts text messages on its text output port "
  def __init__(self, name, host = ""): 
    # call the parent constructor
    Module.__init__(self, name, cmdine = "bin/put", host = host)
    self.addPort("text", direction = "out")

...

putmodule = PutModle("put")
...

outport = putmodule.getPort("text")
outport.link(inport)
</pre>
<a href="tictac_2.py" type="text/x-script.phyton">code</a>

<h2> Primes</h2>

The primes example requires the modules to be synchronized. It also
shows how to combine several modules into a <b>component</b>.

<h3>Without synchronization</h3>

The simplest version is again a producer-consumer with two modules: 
<ul>

      <li> <i>compute</i> loops over integers, and checks whether they
      are prime numbers. Those that are found to be prime (with a
      simple brute-force algorithm) are sent on its output port
      <i>primesOut</i>.

      <li> <i>visu</i> opens a graphical window and displays the
      primes received on its <i>primesIn</i> input port as dots
      on a spiral.
</ul>

Go to the <code>&lt;flowvr source
dir&gt;/flowvr/flowvr-examples/primes</code> directory and compile the
modules with <code>bash make-app.sh</code>. The module executables
appear in the <code>bin/</code> subdirectory.

<p>
The source of the modules is generously commented, so it is also a
good starting point for module programming.

<p>
The flowvrapp code for this application is thus:
<p><pre>
from flowvrapp import *

computerun = FlowvrRunSSHMultiple('bin/compute', hosts = 'localhost', prefix = 'compute')
compute = Module("compute/0", run = computerun)
compute.addPort("primesOut", direction = "out")

visu = Module("visu", cmdline = "bin/visu")
visu.addPort("primesIn", direction = "in")

compute.getPort("primesOut").link(visu.getPort("primesIn"))

app.generate_xml("primes")
</pre>
<a href="primes_0.py" type="text/x-script.phyton">code</a>
<p>

The code is similar to the tictac example. 
A <code>FlowvrRunSSHMultiple</code> object is required for the compute module because 
it is designed to be run in several instances (more on this <a href="#morecompute">later</a>).

<p>
Compile and run with
<pre>
python primes_0.py
flowvr primes
</pre>

Depending on the relative speed of the CPU and display, <i>compute</i> 
may produce prime numbers faster than <i>visu</i> module can
display them. When messages are not consumed, they stack up into
flowvrd's memory, which eventually fills up and crashes the
application.

<p>
<img src="primes_0.png">


<h3>Synchronization basics </h3>

We have to dive a little more into how FlowVR handles messages. 

<h4>Stamps</h4>

Messages have metadata associated with them, called <b>stamps</b>. 
Empty messages that have only metadata are called <b>stamps messages</b>.

<p>
A stamp is a dictionary that maps names to values, it 
contains at least an iteration number (named <i>it</i>).
Ports are defined to transmit either the message and its stamps (<b>full port</b>), 
or just the stamps (<b>stamps port</b>). 

<p>
The connection rules are: 
<ul>
      <li> ports of the same type can be connected

      <li> full output ports can be linked to stamps input ports: they
      get only the stamps part of the messages

      <li> stamps output ports cannot be linked to full input ports

</ul>

<h4>A module event loop</h4>


A module is a event processing loop which usually has the form: 

<pre>
  // initialize API
  ...
  while (!module -> wait())
  {
     // read input message
     module -> get(input_port, input_message);

     // handle messge
     ....

     // write output message
     module -> put(output_port, output_message);
  }
</pre>

The <code>wait()</code> call returns when there is a message on <b>all</b>
its input ports that are connected (non-connected ports are ignored). <code>wait()</code>
returns true when the application should be stopped.

<p>
All modules have two predefined stamps ports: <i>beginIt</i> and <i>endIt</i>. 
A message is automatically sent on <i>endIt</i> every time the module enters <code>wait()</code>.
Symmetrically, the processing cannot start if <i>beginIt</i> is connected and there is no message 
on it. 

<h4>Controlling the module's output rate</h4>

In our case, in order to limit the throughput of <i>compute</i>, <i>visu</i>'s
<i>endIt</i> can be linked to compute's <i>beginIt</i>. This way, <i>compute</i> will not start 
an iteration before <i>visu</i> has ended processing the previous:
<pre>
...
visu.getPort("endIt").link(compute.getPort("beginIt"))
....
</pre>
<a href="primes_1.py" type="text/x-script.phyton">code</a>

<p>
The output rate of the module is effectively controlled in this way. 

<p>
This example happens to work because <i>compute</i>'s event loop
is not exactly as described above: a message is sent on the <i>primesOut</i>
port before the first call to <code>wait()</code>. If the two
modules would use the standard loop above, they would deadlock.

<p>
Also, computation and visualization are not simultaneous, because at
any moment at least one of the two modules is 
waiting for a message to arrive on its input port: they are not
executing in parallel. This can be viewed on the sketch below: 
<p>
<img src="primes_1_timeline.jpg">
<p>
Each horizontal line represents what a module is doing over
time. Arrows between axes show the exchanged messages.


<h4>The presignal filter</h4>

Intuitively, making them run in parallel just requires that <i>compute</i> is
run two times instead of one before it has to wait for <i>visu</i>'s
signal. This could be coded in the compute module. However,
hard-coding the number of <code>put</code>s before the first <code>wait</code> does not
scale: if more modules are in the loop, this number has to be adjusted
also, so it depends on the FlowVR graph topology.

<p>
Therefore, there is a special kind of primitive, the <b>PreSignal</b>,
that transmits stamps messages, and also sends a specified number of
messages before its first wait. 

<p>
The pre-signal is not a module, it is a <b>filter</b>. Filters are
primitives that run as a thread in the FlowVR daemon, and that have
access to the message queues of their ports. They do not necessarily
have a <i>beginIt</i> and an <i>endIt</i>. 

<p>
In FlowvrApp, standard filters are defined in the library
<code>filters.py</code>. The PreSignal can be used with:

<pre>
from flowvrapp import *
from filters import *

...

# nb is the number of messages to send before the first wait
presignal = FilterPreSignal("presignal", nb = 1)

visu.getPort("endIt").link(presignal.getPort("in"))
presignal.getPort("out").link(compute.getPort("beginIt"))
...
</pre>
<a href="primes_2.py" type="text/x-script.phyton">code</a>

<p>
The corresponding graph is: 
<p>
<img src="primes_2.png">








<h3>Synchronizing multiple inputs</h3>

<h4>An example</h4>

Now the display of <i>visu</i> will be controlled by the user: a
new module, <i>capture</i>, opens a window and waits for key events on the
window. It sends messages at a predefined frequency (1 kHz) containing
the state of the arrow keys.

<p>
The <i>visu</i> module now has two connected inputs, <i>keysIn</i> and
<i>primesIn</i>:
<pre>
... 
capture = Module("primes/capture", cmdline = "bin/capture")
capture.addPort("keysOut")

capture.getPort("keysOut").link(visu.getPort("keysIn"))
...
</pre>
<a href="primes_3.py" type="text/x-script.phyton">code</a>

<p>
It processes the messages only when there is at least one available on
each port. In this case, <i>capture</i> is producing messages faster than
<i>compute</i>. Therefore, the capture messages are queueing up in flowvrd,
eventually crashing it.

<a name="greedydecomp">
<h4>Synchronizers</h4>

To avoid this, we use a <b>synchronizer</b>. Similar to a filter,
synchronizers are primitives that run in the FlowVR daemon. 

<p>
Here, we use a <b>GreedySynchronizer</b> synchronizer. It has
two stamps input ports: <i>endIt</i> (yes, it is an input port) and
<i>stamps</i>. Port <i>endIt</i> shoud be connected to a port that outputs
messages slowly, and <i>stamps</i> should be connected to a fast
port. Every time a slow message arrives, the last fast message that
arrived is sent on the GreedySynchronizer's output port,
<i>order</i>. Previous fast messages are discarded. 

<p>
The GreedySynchronizer handles stamps messages, but here the
messages to be subsampled, from <i>capture</i>'s <i>keysOut</i>, are full: the <i>order</i>
port will output only the stamps part of the message. 

<p>
To get the full message, we can use a <b>FilterIt</b> filter. A
FilterIt transmits messages from its <i>in</i> port to its <i>out</i>
port. Transmitted messages are selected on the <i>it</i> field
of their stamps, other messages are dropped. The selected
<i>it</i>'s are those of the stamps messages received on the
<i>order</i> port of the FilterIt.

<p>
By chaining the <i>order</i> ports of the GreedySynchronizer and the
FilterIt, it is possible to apply the same filtering on the stamps and
the full message of the "fast" port.

<p>
In our case, the slow port is that comming from <i>compute</i>
via <i>presignal</i>, and the fast one, that of <i>capture</i>. 
Therefore, we can synchronize them with: 
<pre>
... 

sync = GreedySynchronizor("sync")
presignal.getPort("out").link(sync.getPort("endIt"))
capture.getPort("keysOut").link(sync.getPort("stamps"))

filterit = FilterIt("filterit")
capture.getPort("keysOut").link(filterit.getPort("in"))
sync.getPort("order").link(filterit.getPort("order"))

filterit.getPort("out").link(visu.getPort('keysIn'))
...
</pre>
<a href="primes_4.py" type="text/x-script.phyton">code</a>


<p>
The corresponding graph is: 

<p>
<img src="primes_4.png">

<h4>Further reading</h4>

More information on the available filters and synchronizers can be found
in the Doxygen documentation, generated in FlowVR's build directory by 
<pre>
make doc-flowvr
</pre>
Then point a browser to <code>flowvr/doc/html/index.html</code> in the
build directory.



<h3>Composites</h3>

When FlowVR applications get larger, a linear description of the graph
becomes harder to read. It becomes useful to group primitives together
into <b>composites</b>. 


<h4>Grouping primitives</h4>

It is convenient to handle a set of related primitives as if it was a
single object. Therefore, composites have a <code>getPort</code>
method that can be used to expose the ports of the enclosed
primitives. They do not have an <code>addPort</code>, though: ports
can only be created on primitives.

<p>
It is conventional to see composites like directories in a file
hierachy. Therefore, primitives in a composite are of the form
<code>compositeName/primitiveName</code> (the slash indicates the
structure). Composites can be nested also.

<p>
An object that is either a primitive or a composite is called a
<b>component</b>.

<p>
In our example, a <code>Display</code> composite will group together
<i>visu</i> and <i>capture</i>, and simply expose <i>visu</i>'s
<i>primesIn</i> and <i>endIt</i>: 

<pre>
class Display(Conponent):  
  """ Displays primes in a window, and a secondary control window """

  def __init__(self, prefix):
    Component.__init__(self)
    
    visu = Module(prefix + "/visu", cmdline = "bin/visu")
    ... 
    capture = Module(prefix + "/capture", cmdline = "bin/capture")
    ... 
    presignal = ...
    sync = ...

    ### expose input and output ports

    self.ports["endIt"] = visu.getPort("endIt")
    self.ports["primesIn"] = visu.getPort("primesIn")
    

display = Display("display")
compute.getPort("primesOut").link(display.getPort("primesIn"))
</pre>
<a href="primes_5.py" type="text/x-script.phyton">code</a>

<p>
The <code>prefix</code> is the prefix of all primitives in the
composite. Note that the <i>presignal</i>
that was used for both <i>compute</i> and <i>sync</i> has to be
duplicated.

<h4>The greedy</h4>

In fact, the synchronization pattern described <a
href="#greedydecomp">above</a>, that re-samples messages from a fast
port to match the speed of a slower port is classical: it is
called a <b>Greedy</b>.

<p>
The composite encapsulating the primitives of a Greedy is a
<code>Greedy</code> object (defined in the <code>filters.py</code>
library), so the code above can be simplified to:

<pre>
...
class Display(Component):  

  def __init__(self, prefix):
    ...
    # greedy that samples captures's keysOut at the speed of visu's endIt
    greedy = Greedy(prefix + "/greedy")

    visu.getPort("endIt").link(greedy.getPort("sync"))
    capture.getPort("keysOut").link(greedy.getPort("in"))
    greedy.getPort("out").link(visu.getPort("keysIn"))
    ...

</pre>        
<a href="primes_6.py" type="text/x-script.phyton">code</a>


<a name="morecompute">    
<h3>Multiplying compute modules</h3>

Now we can run several instances of compute, to exploit mulitple CPUs
or modules on other machines. We will group the computation modules in
a <i>Compute</i> composite.

<h4>Running more instances</h4>

The <code>FlowvrRunSSHMultiple</code> object we saw previously runs
several instances of an executable. It is called like 
<pre>
computerun = FlowvrRunSSHMultiple("bin/compute", hosts = "mohawk mohawk opata", prefix = "compute")
</pre>

Where: 
<ul>
      <li> the first argument is the command line of the module to run

      <li> <code>hosts</code> is a string with host names, separated
      by spaces. If a host appears several times, the module is run in
      several instances the specified machine. 

      <li> <code>prefix</code> is the prefix of the name of the
      modules. 
</ul>

<p>
In this case, the corresponding modules must be constructed like:
<pre>
module = Module("compute/0", run = computerun)
module = Module("compute/1", run = computerun)
module = Module("compute/2", run = computerun)
</pre>
The name of the module must match the prefix given to
<code>FlowvrRunSSHMultiple</code>, and they are numbered from 0 to n-1
(n is the number of instances).


<h4>Merging results</h4>

The <code>FilterMerge</code> filter has an arbitrary number of input
ports, <i>in0</i>, <i>in1</i>,..., <i>inn-1</i>. When a message is
available on all of its ports, they are concatenated into a single
message that is sent on the <i>out</i> port. New input ports are
added to the <code>FilterMerge</code> with <code>newInputPort()</code>.

<p>
We have the necessary components for our parallel compute: 
<pre>

class Compute(Component):
  
  def __init__(self, prefix, hosts):
    Component.__init__(self)
    
    computerun = FlowvrRunSSHMultiple('bin/compute', hosts = hosts, prefix = prefix)

    # hosts_list: convert hosts to a list
    hosts_list = hosts.split()
    ninstance = len(hosts_list) 

    merge = FilterMerge(prefix + '/merge')
    all_beginIts = []

    for i in range(ninstance): 
      compute = Module(prefix + "/" + str(i), run = computerun)
      compute.addPort("primesOut", direction = "out")

      compute.getPort("primesOut").link(merge.newInputPort())
      all_beginIts.append(compute.getPort("beginIt"))
      
    self.ports["primesOut"] = merge.getPort("out")
    self.ports["beginIt"] = tuple(all_beginIts)

...

compute = Compute("compute", hosts = "localhost " * 4)
display = Display("display")
compute.getPort("primesOut").link(display.getPort("primesIn"))

</pre>
<a href="primes_7.py" type="text/x-script.phyton">code</a>

<p>
A few comments: 
<ul>

      <li> The <code>host = "localhost " * 4</code> specifies that the
      <i>compute</i> modules should be run on the local host in four
      instances (in Python a string muliplied by an int returns this
      number of concatenated strings). 
       
      <li> <code>all_beginIts</code> is a list of all <i>beginIt</i>
      ports that must be connected. For an input port <i>inC</i> of a
      composite, it is acceptable to have a tuple of primitive input
      ports. This means that a port connected to <i>inC</i> should be
      connected to all the primitive ports.

</ul>

<h4>On multiple hosts</h4>

Running this example in 4 instances on the machine mohawk (which is
the localhost) plus 4 more instances on opata should be a matter of
setting
<pre>
compute = Compute("compute", hosts = "mohawk " * 4 + "opata " * 4)
</pre>

Unfortunately a few more adjustments are necessary: 
<pre>

class Compute(Component):
...
    for i in range(ninstance): 
      compute = Module(prefix + "/" + str(i), run = computerun, <b>host = hosts_list[i]</b>)
...

class Display(Component):  
... 
    visu.run.options += "-x DISPLAY "
    capture.run.options += "-x DISPLAY "
...    
app.default_host = "mohawk"

compute = Compute("compute", hosts = "mohawk " * 4 + "opata " * 4)
</pre>
<a href="primes_8.py" type="text/x-script.phyton">code</a>

<p>
Where: 
<ul>
      <li> <code>app.default_host</code> is set to localhost, but
      FlowVR is confused because localhost is the same as
      mohawk. Therefore, all primitives should be mapped by default on mohawk.

      <li> since the modules that use X (the graphical interface) are
      not running on the localhost anymore, they don't have access to
      the <code>DISPLAY</code> variable. It must be explicitly
      propargated to the modules with 
      <code>visu.run.options += "-x DISPLAY "</code>. 

      <li> the <i>compute</i> modules need to be mapped explicitly on
      the hosts they are running on, via <code>host = </code>
      options. Order does matter.

</ul>


<h4>Tree merge</h4>

We are in a context where computations are run on many "slave"
machines, and the results of the computations must be merged on a
central "master" machine.  A simple way of doing this is to send all
the bits to the master and do the merging on it. However, due to the
message fragmentation and the cost of merging results, this may
overload the master, while the slaves are idle.

<p>
A solution to this is to make sub-groups of slaves and merge the
results on these subgroups. This can be done recursively, in a tree of
merges: 

<pre>
def make_filter_tree(prefix, in_ports, out_port, 
                     arity = 2, node_class = FilterMerge):
  ...

class Compute(Component):
  
  def __init__(self, prefix, hosts, out_port):
    ... 
    all_primesOut = []

    for i in range(ninstance): 
      compute = Module(prefix + "/" + str(i), run = computerun, host = hosts_list[i])
      all_primesOut.append(compute.getPort("primesOut"))
      ...      
    make_filter_tree(prefix + '/tree', all_primesOut, out_port)

...
    
display = Display("display")

hosts = "mohawk " * 4 + "opata " * 4
compute = Compute("compute", hosts = hosts, out_port = display.getPort("primesIn"))
</pre>
<a href="primes_9.py" type="text/x-script.phyton">code</a>

<p>
The function <code>make_filter_tree</code> is not standard, it is
defined in <code>primes_9.py</code>. It needs to know where the input ports and the
output port come from, to decide where to map the tree nodes. The
resulting tree looks like:

<h2>Extras</h2>


<h3>Source files</h3>

The source files of the Python FlowvrApp are:

<ul>

<li> <code>flowvrapp.py</code> contains classes for the basic objects
of flowvr app (Primitve, Module, Filter, Port) and generation code for
the .run.xml and .cmd.xml files

<li> <code>filters.py</code> contains classes for standard flowvr filters

<li> <code>portutils.py</code> is a limited implementation of the
Portutils's flowvrapp side. It contains the PortModule primitive.

<li> <code>balzac.py</code> contains the BalzacLostInSpaceViewer and
an implementation of the Balzac tutorial.

</ul>



<h3>Further reading</h3>


This is the end of this tutorial. For further information, you can look at: 
<ul>

      <li> the Python FlowVRApp is less than 400 line of code, so
      don't be shy of taking a look at it.

      <li> for the module API, look at the Doxygen documentation of
      the code, which is at least an easy way to navigate in the
      source files.

      <li> the example modules. They are well commented and
      up-to-date, since they also serve as test cases for FlowVR
      developers.

</ul>
