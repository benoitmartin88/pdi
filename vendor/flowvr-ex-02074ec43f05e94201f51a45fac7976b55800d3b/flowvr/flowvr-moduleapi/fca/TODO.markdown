# Things to do #


## Segments handling ##

Test the following functions:

- `fca_add_segment()`
- `fca_remove_segment()`


## Stamps handling ##

Writing of a stamp to a message:

    fca_write_stamp(msg, my_stamp, "A string containing the information.");

Reading of a stamp from a message: IN PROGRESS (but ugly)

    const char *my_stamp = fca_read_stamp(msg, source_stamp);

Implement a correct way to free memory from unused stamps.

It would  be interesting to add  a way to  know the number of  current allocated
buffers  but as  far as  I know  the “flowvr::BufferPool”'s  interface  does not
provide this kind of information.


## Doxygen ##

Make the documentation generated by Doxygen more complete (problems with macros)
and more readable (the index file is (almost) empty!!!).
