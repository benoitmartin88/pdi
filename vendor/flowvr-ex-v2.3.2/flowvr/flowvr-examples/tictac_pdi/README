===============================
	TicTac-PDI
===============================

!!!!! A MORE INTEGRATED VERSION IS AVIALABLE IN PDI 

===============================
	What does it do?
===============================
	TicTac_PDI is a variation of the FLowVR base example TicTac.
        It relies on  the PDI plugin for FlowVR
	Instead of using the FLowvr API, the modules  (src/put.cxx and src/get.cxx)
	rely on PDI  to expose their data. The ports and output message structure is
	specified in the yml files src/put.yml and src/get.yml but net installed in bin with the module executables
	The tictac.py also read  the bin/put.yml and bin/get.yml  files to build the module representations (ports,traces)
