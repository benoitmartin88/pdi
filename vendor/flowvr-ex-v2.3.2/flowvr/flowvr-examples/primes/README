	What does it do?
===============================
 	* Module "compute" computes prime numbers.
 	* Module "visu" draws a visualization of the computed numbers.
 	* Module "capture" listens to keyboard events.
 		Using the arrows will rotate the visualization.
===============================

In this example, you can change the complexity of the generated network
by adding a number between 1 and 8 in the network generation step : 

"python primes.py 5"

The default value is 4.

An alternative file "primes_corepref.py" shows how to bind modules on specific processor cores.

===============================
	How to start it
===============================
You can start it by executing "flowvr-demo-primes.sh".
If you do not have it in your $PATH, execute "source bin/flowvr-suite-config.sh"
at the root of your install directory.

In order to start it manually:

	* Execute "flowvrd &" in your terminal or "flowvrd" in a separate terminal.
		- Only one daemon may run on a given machine.
		- If you need to bring back a command from the background, run "fg".
		- To close the daemon, use CTRL-C.
		
flowvrd &
		
		
	* Compile the application's modules using the provided makefile.
	
./make-app.sh
	
	* Source the config file to set some env varaibles:
       
 source  bin/primes-config.sh
	
	* Generate the application's network using the provided py-flowvrapp script.
	
python primes.py
		
	* Launch the application using the "flowvr" command.
		flowvr primes
		
		
		While the application is running, your terminal will listen
		to commands for controlling the application flow.

		To get a list of available commands, type "pause", press ENTER to confirm,
		then type "help" and confirm.


	* When you are done, type "stop" and confirm.
	
	* If the application has trouble coming to a full halt, run :

flowvr-kill


===============================
	Troubleshooting
===============================

	* The daemon won't start properly
		1) make sure you've executed the "setup-sharedmemory.sh" script
			This script sets the shared memory segment size to a big enough value
			in order to accomodate the daemon.
			
		2) check if there isn't a daemon already running
		3) run "killall flowvrd" if you haven't found any
		
	* The application starts, but it doesn't exchange messages
		- run "flowvr-kill" and try once more
