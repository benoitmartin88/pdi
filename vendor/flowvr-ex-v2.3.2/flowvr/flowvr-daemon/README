    FlowVR Deamon and Base Plugins


This package contains the flowvrd program and the associated plugins
and also a basic controller (flowvr-telnet).

flowvrd must be launched on all nodes to be able to run a flowvr
application.


FlowVR Plugins Mini How To
==========================

A FlowVR deamon plugin must derive from the class
flowvr::plugd::Object and implements the methods init, createAction,
doAction, close.

See flowvr-tests/src/plugins/flowvr.tests.Reverse.cpp for an example.

Synchronizor plugins can use the class flowvr::plugins::Synchronizor and
filters can use the class flowvr::plugins::Filter.


Compilation
-----------

Plugins must be compiled as a shared library with the same name as the
plugin's class with dots between each namespace (and a -debug suffix
for the debugging version).
flowvr uses pkg-config to specify compilation and link parameters. You
must specify the package name flowvr-plugd (or flowvr-plugd-debug for
the debugging version) and --cflags for compilation or --libs for
link. For example:

   g++ -shared -o flowvr.tests.Reverse.so flowvr.tests.Reverse.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs flowvr-plugd`

The resulting file must then be located in a directory included in the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable when the deamon is launched.

To instanciate a plugin you can pass the command <addobject> (with
flowvr-telnet). For example:

  <addobject id="f" class="flowvr.tests.Reverse"/>
