This is the tictac example for FlowVR.
In order to start it, do:

* install flowvr and ensure the source the configuration .sh
* type
  ./make-app.sh
  flowvr-demo-tictac.sh
  
* in order to stop it, type "STOP" in the console

The flowvr-demo-fluid.sh is located in the bin directory
of your flowvr installation folder (after installation).
After sourcing the flowvr-config.sh it should be found.

Please read the FlowVR manual for more details. You can 
find the documentation as seperate project on the SVN:

svn co https://wiki-flowvr.imag.fr/svn/flowvr-suite/trunk/flowvr-doc 
       <your_local_repository>
       
Have fun,

the FlowVR team.
