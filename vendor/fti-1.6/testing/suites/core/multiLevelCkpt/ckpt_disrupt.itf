    # The difference is that checkpoints are disrupted between the runs.

    # Type is enconded in 'disrupt' and can be 'erase' or 'corrupt'.

    # Target can be:
    # - first local 'ckpt' files with 'Rank' prefix;
    # - first local 'partner' files with 'Pcof' or 'RSed' prefix;
    # - everything from the 'global'/l4 folder for that application run;
    # - the whole 'node' folder in the local checkpoint directory.
    #
    # Consecutive tells ITF which nodes to disrupt.
    # The variable can assume 'true', 'false' or 'irrelevant' (any string).
    # The latter is used on global checkpoints and node directories.
    #
    # The test also has a 'expected' variable to encode the expected result.
    # It can be 'success' for when FTI can recover from the scenario.
    # It can also be 'failure' for when FTI cannot recover from the scenario.
